        <br><strong>1)</strong>For the goal of proving all my hard work in 4 years in one single application.
        <br><strong>2)</strong>To get the license I deserve
        <br><strong>3)</strong>To finish an important part of my life.
        <br>Details about the data I will collect:
        <br>- E-mails : that will never be used in any bad way.
        <br>- Password: that can not be read by me ( the programmer ) being secured by google framework (Firebase).
        <br>- Phone mode: so that the application can know how to addapt in the future for all phone models.
        <br>
